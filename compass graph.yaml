  description: |
    A YAML definition file outlining the structure, axes, interpretation,
    and conceptual basis for the 'Skill Compass' visualization,
    designed to map skills based on mastery and experience context.
  intended_use: |
    Guidance for AI models (like those using MCP - Metacognitive Prompting),
    developers, or designers to understand or implement the Skill Compass chart.

# 2. Core Concept
concept:
  name: Skill Compass
  analogy: Political Compass Chart
  core_idea: |
    To visually plot individual skills on a two-dimensional grid,
    where each axis represents a different aspect of the skill's
    relationship to the individual (mastery and context).

# 3. Purpose
purpose:
  primary: |
    Provide a creative, visual, and informative representation of an
    individual's skill set for portfolios, resumes, or personal tracking.
  secondary: |
    Allow viewers to quickly grasp not only the proficiency level but also
    the primary environment (e.g., freelance vs. formal employment)
    where skills have been applied or developed.

# 4. Chart Structure
structure:
  type: 2D Cartesian Plane / Scatter Plot
  layout: Four Quadrants defined by intersecting X and Y axes at origin (0,0).
  axes:
    x_axis:
      id: mastery
      label: Skill Mastery
      orientation: Horizontal
      scale_type: Continuous Spectrum # Conceptually, can be mapped to numerical range e.g., -1 to +1
      endpoint_left:
        label: Learning
        value_description: Represents skills currently being learned, less familiar, or at a beginner/intermediate stage.
        conceptual_value: Low / Negative (e.g., -1)
      endpoint_right:
        label: Proficient
        value_description: Represents skills well-understood, frequently used, or at an advanced/expert stage.
        conceptual_value: High / Positive (e.g., +1)
      origin_meaning: Mid-point proficiency, intermediate level, or basic competence.

    y_axis:
      id: context
      label: Experience Context
      orientation: Vertical
      scale_type: Continuous Spectrum # Conceptually, can be mapped to numerical range e.g., -1 to +1
      endpoint_top:
        label: Freelance
        value_description: Skills primarily gained, utilized, or developed in freelance projects, personal initiatives, or independent work settings.
        conceptual_value: High / Positive (e.g., +1)
      endpoint_bottom:
        label: Work Experience
        value_description: Skills primarily gained, utilized, or developed within formal employment structures, team-based corporate environments.
        conceptual_value: Low / Negative (e.g., -1)
      origin_meaning: Neutral context, skill applied equally/significantly in both freelance and work settings, or context is mixed/irrelevant.

  quadrants:
    - id: top_left
      x_range: Negative (Learning)
      y_range: Positive (Freelance)
      description: Skills being learned, primarily in freelance/independent contexts.
    - id: top_right
      x_range: Positive (Proficient)
      y_range: Positive (Freelance)
      description: Proficient skills, primarily used in freelance/independent contexts.
    - id: bottom_left
      x_range: Negative (Learning)
      y_range: Negative (Work Experience)
      description: Skills being learned, primarily within formal work experience.
    - id: bottom_right
      x_range: Positive (Proficient)
      y_range: Negative (Work Experience)
      description: Proficient skills, primarily used within formal work experience.

# 5. Data Representation
data:
  points:
    type: Individual Skills
    examples: [ 'Python', 'AWS', 'Photoshop', 'Project Management', 'React' ]
  plotting_method:
    description: |
      Each skill is represented as a point (e.g., dot, icon, logo) placed
      within the chart grid based on a subjective or objective assessment
      of its position along the Mastery (X) and Context (Y) axes.
    coordinate_assignment: |
      Assign conceptual coordinates (e.g., Mastery score from -1 to +1,
      Context score from -1 to +1) to each skill to determine its plot position.

# 6. Interpretation Guide
interpretation:
  general: |
    The location of a skill provides a quick visual summary of both the
    individual's confidence/expertise level (horizontal position) and the
    primary domain of application/experience (vertical position).
  reading_the_axes:
    horizontal: Further right = more proficient. Further left = still learning.
    vertical: Higher = more freelance/independent context. Lower = more formal work experience context.
  quadrant_meaning: Each quadrant combines the interpretations of its corresponding axis segments.
  central_placement: Points near the origin indicate intermediate mastery and/or balanced context application.

# 7. Potential Enhancements / Variations (Optional)
enhancements:
  - Use technology logos/icons instead of simple points.
  - Add interactivity (hover effects to show skill details).
  - Include a third dimension (e.g., size of the point for frequency of use or project impact).
  - Refine axis labels (e.g., 'Independent Projects' instead of 'Freelance', or specific proficiency levels like 'Beginner', 'Advanced', 'Expert').
